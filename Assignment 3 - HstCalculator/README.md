# Assignment 3 - HstCalculator
**Date:** November 21, 2022

The "HST Calculator" is a Python GUI application designed to show the fundamental concepts of GUI programming and 
event-driven programming. This application allows users to input a pre-tax dollar amount, calculates the HST at a rate 
of 13%, and displays the total amount including tax. It serves as a functional demonstration of applying Python and the 
Tkinter library to create interactive and user-friendly desktop applications. The project emphasizes the application of 
constants, function definitions, and GUI widget handling, providing a hands-on experience with Python's versatility 
in developing applications with real-world utility.
