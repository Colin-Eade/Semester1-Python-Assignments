# Semester 1 - Introduction to Programming Assignments
This repository showcases the five main assignments completed  from the 
'Introduction to Programming' course, a core component of my first semester 
in the Computer Programming and Analysis program. Each assignment is designed
to demonstrate foundational programming concepts and skills using Python,
from basic syntax and control structures to more intermediate problem-solving 
techniques. These projects reflect my initial journey into software development 
and my growth as a programmer. 

**Note:** For more detail and visuals of each assignment, please refer 
to the README files located within their respective folders. These contain 
descriptions and images that illustrate the assignments in greater detail.
